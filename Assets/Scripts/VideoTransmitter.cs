//This class contains functions that control video playback of the users.
//They create gameobjects which are instantiated in every player's game. The players
//read this object in Update() and act appropriately. We did it this way
//because of endless bugs with RPCs and other official communication methods.
//A new addition to this is that the Vector3 is being used to carry a message.
//All users recieve the instantiated object and will check if the first float
//of the Vector3 is equal to their id after casting it from float to int.
//If it does or if it is 0 they will act on it, 0 representing a message intended
//for all users.
//Note that in order for an object to be instantiated over the network, a prefab
//needs to be in the Resources foleder on both tourist and tour leader.
